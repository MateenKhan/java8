A collection is an in-memory data structure to hold values and before we start using collection, all the values should have been populated.
Whereas a java Stream is a data structure that is computed on-demand

All the Java Stream API interfaces and classes are in the java.util.stream package

Since we can use primitive data types such as int, long in the collections using auto-boxing and these operations could take a lot of time,
there are specific classes for primitive types â€“ IntStream, LongStream and DoubleStream.
